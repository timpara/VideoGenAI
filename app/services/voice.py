The poem describes the poet on a quiet night, looking at the bright moon outside his window and being reminded of his distant hometown and loved ones, expressing his deep longing for them. The full poem reads: "Before my bed the moonlight gleams, I wonder if it is frost on the ground. I lift my head and gaze at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of home." In these four short lines, the poet uses the images of "the bright moon" and "thinking of home" to convey the loneliness and sorrow of someone far from home. The opening line "Before my bed the moonlight gleams" sets the scene, with the bright moonlight prompting the poet's reverie; "I wonder if it is frost on the ground" adds a sense of cold and deepens the loneliness; "I lift my head and gaze at the bright moon" and "I lower my head and think of home" raise the emotion, showing the homesickness and longing in the poet's heart. This poem is simple, clear, and sincere, one of the most famous in classical Chinese poetry, and is loved and admired by later generations.

        What is the meaning of life? This question has puzzled philosophers, scientists, and thinkers of all kinds for centuries. Throughout history, various cultures and individuals have come up with their interpretations and beliefs around the purpose of life. Some say it's to seek happiness and self-fulfillment, while others believe it's about contributing to the welfare of others and making a positive impact in the world. Despite the myriad of perspectives, one thing remains clear: the meaning of life is a deeply personal concept that varies from one person to another. It's an existential inquiry that encourages us to reflect on our values, desires, and the essence of our existence.

A young boy named Alex, around 8 years old, is playing in his front yard with his loyal dog, Buddy.]\n\n[Camera zooms in on Alex as he throws a ball for Buddy to fetch. Buddy excitedly runs after it and brings it back to Alex.]\n\nAlex: Good boy, Buddy! You're the best dog ever!\n\n[Buddy barks happily and wags his tail.]\n\n[As Alex and Buddy continue playing, a series of potential dangers loom nearby, such as a stray dog approaching, a ball rolling towards the street, and a suspicious-looking stranger walking by.]\n\nAlex: Uh oh, Buddy, look out!\n\n[Buddy senses the danger and immediately springs into action. He barks loudly at the stray dog, scaring it away. Then, he rushes to retrieve the ball before it reaches the street and gently nudges it back towards Alex. Finally, he stands protectively between Alex and the stranger, growling softly to warn them away.]\n\nAlex: Wow, Buddy, you're like my superhero!\n\n[Just as Alex and Buddy are about to head inside, they hear a loud crash from a nearby construction site. They rush over to investigate and find a pile of rubble blocking the path of a kitten trapped underneath.]\n\nAlex: Oh no, Buddy, we have to help!\n\n[Buddy barks in agreement and together they work to carefully move the rubble aside, allowing the kitten to escape unharmed. The kitten gratefully nuzzles against Buddy, who responds with a friendly lick.]\n\nAlex: We did it, Buddy! We saved the day again!\n\n[As Alex and Buddy walk home together, the sun begins to set, casting a warm glow over the neighborhood.]\n\nAlex: Thanks for always being there to watch over me, Buddy. You're not just my dog, you're my best friend.\n\n[Buddy barks happily and nuzzles against Alex as they disappear into the sunset, ready to face whatever adventures tomorrow may bring.]\n\n[End scene.]"

        text = "Hi everyone, I'm Joe, the guy who wants to help you pay off all your credit cards!\nToday we're talking about the cash advance feature on credit cards.\nHave you ever taken a credit card to an ATM to get cash because you were short on funds? If so, you should really watch this video.\nIt's 2024 now, and I thought no one would still be using the credit card cash advance feature. A few days ago a fan sent me a picture - a cash advance of 10,000.\nThere are three drawbacks to credit card cash advances.\nOne, the cash advance feature has a real cost. You get charged a cash advance fee first. For example, this fan took out 10,000 in cash and was charged a 2.5% fee, which came to 250 yuan.\nTwo, normal credit card purchases have an interest-free period of up to 56 days, but cash advances do not. Interest is charged at 0.05% per day starting from the day of the advance. This fan used it for 11 days and was charged 55 yuan in interest.\nThree, frequent cash advances make the bank think you are short on funds. You will be flagged as a high-risk user, which affects your overall score and credit limit.\nSo what should you do if you are short on funds?\nJoe has a tip for you: use a POS machine to swipe the credit card. You only pay a small fee and you still get the interest-free period of up to 56 days.\nFinally, if you are interested in card tips, you can get a copy of the \"Card God Manual\" from Joe. If you run into any questions while using your card, feel free to talk to Joe.\nDon't forget to follow Joe and reply with 'card tips' to get the \"2024 Card Tips\" for free, and let's become card pros together!"
